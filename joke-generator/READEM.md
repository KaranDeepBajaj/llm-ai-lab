🤖 Gemini Joke Bot

This is a simple Python script that uses Google's Generative AI (gemini-2.0-flash) to tell a light-hearted joke for school kids. It's a great starting point for experimenting with Google's AI APIs.

📦 Requirements
Python 3.8+

A Google API Key with access to Generative AI

The following Python packages:

python-dotenv

google-generativeai

🛠️ Setup
Clone the repo or copy the script into your project folder.

Create a .env file in the same directory as your script:
touch .env

Add your Google API Key to the .env file:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Or install manually:

pip install python-dotenv google-generativeai
🧪 How to Run
python gemini_joke_bot.py

If your key is valid, the script will output a school-friendly joke generated by the Gemini model.
